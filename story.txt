💰 A Story About CPF: The Three Jars
Once upon a time in Singapore, there was a young man named Alex who just landed his first full-time job. On his first payday, he was excited — until he noticed a portion of his salary was taken out.
"Where did my money go?" he wondered.
His HR manager smiled and said, “That’s your CPF contribution. Think of it like this — we’re giving your future a head start.”
🏠 The Ordinary Wages and the Three Jars
The money deducted went into three special jars — each with a purpose.
1. 🧓 Jar 1: Special Account (SA) – This was for Alex’s retirement savings. The money would grow slowly over time, like a tree planted early.
2. 🏡 Jar 2: Ordinary Account (OA) – This was for housing, education, or investment. Someday, Alex could use it to help buy his first flat.
3. ❤️ Jar 3: Medisave Account (MA) – This was for medical expenses. If Alex or his family needed to see a doctor or pay for insurance, this jar had him covered.
As Alex grew older, he realized CPF wasn’t just a deduction — it was a foundation. One that supported him in buying a home, staying healthy, and retiring with peace of mind.
And just like that, he no longer saw CPF as money taken away…  
but money set aside to take care of him
The End.
